# Health and Wellness Project

This project uses data science to investigate healthcare accessibility issues for a stakeholder in Southwest Baltimore, where many residents face challenges such as:
* Distance from clinics and hospitals
* Poverty
* Lack of transportation
These factors contribute to health disparities.

The project aims to:

* Analyze health service deserts using spatial mapping and identify areas at risk for future health concerns.
* Support data-driven interventions to improve healthcare delivery and resource distribution.

A key component is the development of a general health risk predictive model.
